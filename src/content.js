 *  KORA KAAGAZ — EDITION CONTENT
 *  Everything a visitor reads lives in this file: studio details, projects,
 *  case studies, services and contact links. Edit here; the newspaper, the
 *  printed 3D intro and the case-study pages all update from this source.
 *
 *  ⚠ SAMPLE CONTENT: the six projects, their clients and imagery are fictional
 *  placeholders, as are the email address and social handles. They are marked
 *  `sample: true` and labelled on the page. Replace them with real work, then
 *  set `site.sampleNotice` to false.
 *
 *  Images: put files in /public/work and reference them as '/work/name.jpg'.
 *  Same-origin images are recommended — the intro prints the featured image
 *  into a WebGL texture, which needs CORS-enabled images if hosted elsewhere.
