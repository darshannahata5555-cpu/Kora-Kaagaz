 * THE DESK
 * Set `photo.src` to a photographed desk (e.g. generated with Higgsfield — see
 * README) to use it; while it is null, the scene uses the procedural walnut
 * stand-in with a window-light gobo and modelled cup and pencil.
 *
 * Photo mode projects the image onto the desk plane from the opening camera,
 * so the first frame is exactly the photograph and later camera moves get
 * consistent ground-plane parallax. Match `elevation` to the angle the photo
 * appears to be shot from, and `sun` to its light direction (x right, y up,
 * z toward the viewer; upper-left daylight ≈ [-0.55, 0.65, -0.52]).
